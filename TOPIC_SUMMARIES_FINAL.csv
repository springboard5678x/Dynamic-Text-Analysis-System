realize movie simply wasting time unnecessary scene go nowhere story paper thin unstructured stupid incoherent minute disappearance boyfriend car nicole find mobile home rest stop see flashing camera know people inside easily give trying get help one answer door knock informed killer boyfriend danger walk around rest stop sort stupid unnecessary thing includes turning tv even looking amused think stumbled onto porno movie even dire situation sitting around wandering drinking bottle liquor hour end knowing boyfriend abducted killer still loose stalking without taking action ensure immediate safety bother lock door remain alert oh yeah try using radio call help even bother mobile home people inside right rest stop really seems like script writer forgot important fact writing part story sense entrapment ever present danger story heroine freely wanders around various building rest stop killer drive occasionally scare driving nothing stopping nicole simply taking even rest stop long way anywhere else better sitting around chooses stay anyway one point movie main character even acknowledges run story go anywhere instead jump pointless segment pointless segment nicole finally get inside mobile home turn inhabitant family sheltered presumably inbred psychotic religious fanatic seem willfully ignorant uncaring killer action indication connected way kick nicole several minute next irrelevant segment main character wanders bathroom building discovers one killer previous victim young woman named tracy still alive locked closet strange reason tracy start vomiting ridiculous amount blood nicole go fetch crowbar pry open closet door return minute later tracy pool blood disappeared without explanation point nicole find bulletin board showing many missing person see tracy disappeared tracy ghost something writer never bother explaining next cop show middle night man police office rest stop conveniently left unattended entire day far nicole tell going killer drive truck outside office cop go outside confront police officer knowing something seriously wrong go calmly talk killer nicole even pointed guy stalking buy killer lie simply driving needed direction seriously cop talk nicole outside totally unaware pickup truck turn around run cop quickly start telling nicole goner lucky breathing still yet strangely die quite two pointless talking important fact gun annoyingly even mentioned long time two finally try use gun nicole stupidly waste bullet blindly shooting door killer possibly behind two bullet left policeman tell nicole use one euthanize fire one mouth lay still moment chunk blown head suddenly inexplicably yell missed shoot completely cheap attempt shock nicole finally confronts killer fails movie end scene taking place long woman arriving strangely much active rest stop bathroom building hears nicole cry help closet locked like tracy get policeman go inside check find apparently normal clean closet cop leaf thinking tricked battered nicole seen coming behind box closet would easily spotted cop spent second looking apparently stupid said done anything policeman wow movie apparently first new line quality direct dvd movie marketed extreme theater reality clich movie garbage mickey rourke enjoying renaissance moment fair play always liked image acting ability fare angel heart johnny handsome know going get rourke mean moody
